# Student-facing theme: color choices for aspirants

## Goal
Light, soothing theme that does not strain eyes during long study sessions (hours of use).

## Recommended palette (light theme)

| Use            | Color / class        | Rationale |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Page background** | Warm off-white (`stone-50` / `#fafaf9`) | Reduces glare vs pure white; comfortable for long reading. |
| **Content surface** | White or `stone-50`     | Clear, calm; cards stand out with a light border. |
| **Primary text**    | `stone-800`            | Soft black – readable without harsh contrast. |
| **Secondary text**  | `stone-600`            | Labels, hints – clear but not dominant. |
| **Borders**         | `stone-200`            | Subtle separation, no heavy lines. |
| **Primary accent**  | `sky-600` (soothing blue) | Calming; associated with focus and clarity. Good for CTAs and links. |
| **Success**         | `emerald-600`          | Positive feedback without being loud. |
| **Warning**          | `amber-600`           | Visible but not aggressive. |
| **Error**           | `red-600`              | Clear; avoid neon/bright red for large areas. |

## What to avoid for long sessions
- Pure black text on white (harsh).
- Strong purple/indigo gradients (can feel heavy over time).
- Very saturated red/orange for large UI areas.
- Low-contrast gray body text (accessibility).

## Result
Lightweight, warm light theme with soothing blue accents – suitable for aspirants studying for long hours with minimal eye strain.
