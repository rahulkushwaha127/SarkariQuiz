    {"prompt": "Food chain represents:", "answers": ["Random feeding", "Linear transfer of energy from producer to top predator", "Only plants", "Only decomposers"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "A food chain shows a linear sequence of who eats whom—from producers (plants) through consumers to top predators. Energy and nutrients flow along the chain."},
    {"prompt": "Food web is:", "answers": ["Single chain", "Interconnected food chains showing complex feeding relationships", "Only aquatic", "Only terrestrial"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "A food web is a network of interconnected food chains, showing the complex feeding relationships in an ecosystem. Most organisms are part of multiple chains."},
    {"prompt": "Primary producers in an ecosystem are typically:", "answers": ["Herbivores", "Green plants and algae (autotrophs)", "Carnivores", "Decomposers"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Primary producers are autotrophs (green plants, algae, phytoplankton) that convert solar energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis."},
    {"prompt": "Decomposers in an ecosystem include:", "answers": ["Only insects", "Bacteria and fungi that break down dead organic matter", "Only plants", "Only animals"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Decomposers (bacteria, fungi, detritivores) break down dead organisms and waste, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem."},
    {"prompt": "Ecological succession that begins on bare rock is called:", "answers": ["Secondary succession", "Primary succession", "Climax succession", "Aquatic succession"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Primary succession begins on a surface that has never had soil (e.g. bare rock, lava). Secondary succession occurs where soil already exists after a disturbance."},
    {"prompt": "Wetlands act as:", "answers": ["Only wasteland", "Natural water purifiers and flood buffers; support biodiversity", "Only for agriculture", "Only for construction"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Wetlands filter pollutants, absorb floodwaters, recharge groundwater, and support high biodiversity. They are often called 'kidneys of the landscape'."},
    {"prompt": "Mangroves are adapted to:", "answers": ["Only desert", "Saline coastal waters; have breathing roots (pneumatophores)", "Only freshwater", "Only mountains"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Mangroves grow in saline coastal habitats. They have breathing roots (pneumatophores), salt-excreting leaves, and prop roots for support in soft mud."},
    {"prompt": "Largest mangrove forest in India is in:", "answers": ["Kerala", "Sunderbans (West Bengal)", "Gujarat", "Tamil Nadu"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Sunderbans in West Bengal (and Bangladesh) is the largest mangrove forest in India and one of the largest in the world."},
    {"prompt": "Abiotic components of ecosystem include:", "answers": ["Only animals", "Sunlight, water, soil, temperature, minerals", "Only plants", "Only bacteria"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Abiotic components are non-living: sunlight, water, soil, air, temperature, minerals, and pH. They influence the distribution and survival of living organisms."},
    {"prompt": "Ten per cent law in ecology refers to:", "answers": ["Only 10% species", "Only about 10% of energy is transferred to next trophic level; rest is lost", "10% area", "10% population"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The 10% law states that only about 10% of energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next; the rest is lost as heat or used in metabolism."},
    {"prompt": "Aquatic ecosystem includes:", "answers": ["Only oceans", "Freshwater (lakes, rivers) and marine (oceans, estuaries)", "Only ponds", "Only wetlands"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Aquatic ecosystems include freshwater (lakes, rivers, ponds) and marine (oceans, seas, estuaries). Wetlands can be freshwater or coastal."},
    {"prompt": "Climax community in succession is:", "answers": ["First stage", "Stable, final community in balance with climate (e.g. forest)", "Only grassland", "Only barren"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The climax community is the stable, self-perpetuating end stage of succession, in equilibrium with the regional climate (e.g. climax forest)."},
    {"prompt": "Estuary is:", "answers": ["Only river", "Transition zone where river meets sea; mix of fresh and saline water", "Only sea", "Only lake"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body where freshwater from rivers mixes with seawater. It is highly productive and supports diverse life."},
    {"prompt": "Which is a terrestrial ecosystem?", "answers": ["Ocean", "Forest", "Coral reef", "Deep sea"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Terrestrial ecosystems are land-based: forests, grasslands, deserts, tundra. Aquatic ecosystems are water-based."},
    {"prompt": "Pneumatophores are found in:", "answers": ["Desert plants", "Mangroves (breathing roots above mud)", "Alpine plants", "Grasslands"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Pneumatophores are aerial roots in mangroves that project above the mud to take in air, as the soil is waterlogged and oxygen-poor."},
    {"prompt": "Savanna is a type of:", "answers": ["Aquatic ecosystem", "Terrestrial ecosystem (tropical grassland with scattered trees)", "Marine ecosystem", "Wetland"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Savanna is a tropical or subtropical terrestrial ecosystem characterised by grasslands with scattered trees and a distinct dry season."},
    {"prompt": "Phytoplankton are:", "answers": ["Top predators", "Microscopic aquatic producers (base of aquatic food chain)", "Decomposers", "Only in soil"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Phytoplankton are microscopic algae and cyanobacteria in water bodies. They are primary producers and form the base of most aquatic food chains."},
    {"prompt": "Detritus in ecosystem refers to:", "answers": ["Living plants", "Dead organic matter (leaves, dead bodies) being decomposed", "Only minerals", "Only water"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Detritus is dead organic matter (dead leaves, animal remains, waste) that is broken down by decomposers and detritivores."},
    {"prompt": "Niche of a species refers to:", "answers": ["Only its habitat", "Its role and position in the ecosystem (what it eats, where it lives, how it behaves)", "Only food", "Only size"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Ecological niche is the role and position of a species in its environment—including its habitat, diet, behaviour, and interactions with other species."},
    {"prompt": "Biome is:", "answers": ["Single species", "Large ecological area with distinct climate and community (e.g. tropical rainforest)", "Only water body", "Only mountain"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "A biome is a large geographic area with a distinct climate and characteristic community of plants and animals (e.g. tropical rainforest, tundra, desert)."}
