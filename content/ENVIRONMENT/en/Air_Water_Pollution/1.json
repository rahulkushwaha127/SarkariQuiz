When algae die, decomposition consumes oxygen, leading to hypoxia and death of fish and other aquatic life."}, {"prompt": "Marine pollution can come from:", "answers": ["Only ships", "Land runoff, plastic, oil spills, sewage, industrial discharge", "Only oil", "Only plastic"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Marine pollution has many sources: land-based (runoff, rivers), plastic waste, oil spills, sewage, and industrial discharge."}, {"prompt": "Oil spill in water can be cleaned by:", "answers": ["Only dilution", "Containment, skimming, use of dispersants, bioremediation", "Only chemicals", "Only waiting"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Oil spill response includes containment (booms), mechanical recovery (skimmers), dispersants, and sometimes bioremediation (oil-eating bacteria)."}, {"prompt": "Heavy metals in water (e.g. lead, mercury) can cause:", "answers": ["Only taste", "Toxic effects: neurological, kidney damage; bioaccumulation", "Only colour", "Only smell"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Heavy metals are toxic and can cause serious health effects.
