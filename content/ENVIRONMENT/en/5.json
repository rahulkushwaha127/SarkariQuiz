    {"prompt": "Genetic diversity refers to:", "answers": ["Only number of species", "Variety of genes within a species", "Only ecosystem types", "Only habitats"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Genetic diversity is the variety of genes within a species. It allows populations to adapt to changing environments and resist diseases."},
    {"prompt": "Species diversity refers to:", "answers": ["Only genes", "Variety of species in a region (richness and abundance)", "Only one species", "Only plants"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Species diversity is the variety and abundance of different species in an area. It includes species richness (number) and evenness (distribution)."},
    {"prompt": "Ecosystem diversity means:", "answers": ["Only one ecosystem", "Variety of ecosystems (forests, wetlands, grasslands, etc.)", "Only species", "Only genes"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Ecosystem diversity is the variety of ecosystems in a region or the world—e.g. forests, wetlands, coral reefs, grasslands."},
    {"prompt": "Endemic species are:", "answers": ["Found everywhere", "Found only in a particular geographic area and nowhere else", "Only extinct", "Only invasive"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Endemic species are native to and restricted to a specific geographic region (e.g. country, island, hotspot). They are often vulnerable to extinction."},
    {"prompt": "Example of an endemic species in India is:", "answers": ["House crow", "Lion-tailed macaque (Western Ghats)", "Rat", "Pigeon"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Lion-tailed macaque is endemic to the Western Ghats. Other Indian endemics include Nilgiri tahr, Sangai, and many amphibians and plants."},
    {"prompt": "IUCN category 'Critically Endangered' means:", "answers": ["Safe", "Extremely high risk of extinction in the wild", "Least concern", "Data deficient"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Critically Endangered (CR) is the highest risk category for living species before Extinct—facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild."},
    {"prompt": "Vulnerable (VU) in IUCN means:", "answers": ["Extinct", "High risk of endangerment in the wild", "Safe", "Not evaluated"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Vulnerable (VU) species face a high risk of extinction in the wild. The order of risk is: Critically Endangered > Endangered > Vulnerable."},
    {"prompt": "In-situ conservation includes:", "answers": ["Zoo", "National parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves", "Seed bank", "Botanical garden"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "In-situ conservation is on-site conservation in natural habitats—national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, and gene sanctuaries."},
    {"prompt": "Ex-situ conservation includes:", "answers": ["Only national park", "Zoos, botanical gardens, seed banks, gene banks", "Only sanctuary", "Only forest"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Ex-situ conservation is off-site—zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens, seed banks, gene banks, and cryopreservation of genetic material."},
    {"prompt": "Biodiversity hotspot must have:", "answers": ["Only many species", "High endemism and significant loss of habitat (at least 1500 endemic plants, lost 70%+ habitat)", "Only animals", "Only water"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "A biodiversity hotspot must have at least 1500 endemic vascular plant species and have lost at least 70% of its original habitat."},
    {"prompt": "Western Ghats are a biodiversity hotspot because:", "answers": ["Only large area", "High species endemism and threatened by habitat loss", "Only mountains", "Only in India"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Western Ghats have very high endemism (many species found nowhere else) and face threats from deforestation and development."},
    {"prompt": "Rare species are those that:", "answers": ["Very common", "Small population; may be vulnerable or endangered", "Extinct", "Only in zoo"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Rare species have small population sizes and/or restricted distribution. They may become vulnerable or endangered if threats increase."},
    {"prompt": "Indicator species are used to:", "answers": ["Only count", "Assess health of ecosystem; their presence/absence indicates environmental quality", "Only hunt", "Only export"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Indicator species are sensitive to environmental changes. Their presence, absence, or abundance reflects the condition of the ecosystem (e.g. lichens for air quality)."},
    {"prompt": "Umbrella species conservation helps:", "answers": ["Only that species", "Protect many other species that share its habitat", "Only plants", "Only one habitat"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Protecting the habitat of an umbrella species (e.g. tiger, elephant) helps protect many other species that share the same ecosystem."},
    {"prompt": "Flagship species are used for:", "answers": ["Only research", "Conservation marketing to raise awareness and funds (e.g. tiger, panda)", "Only hunting", "Only captive breeding"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Flagship species are charismatic species used to raise public support for conservation (e.g. tiger, giant panda, polar bear)."},
    {"prompt": "Habitat fragmentation:", "answers": ["Increases habitat", "Breaks large habitat into smaller isolated patches; threatens biodiversity", "Only helps species", "Only in ocean"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Habitat fragmentation splits continuous habitat into smaller, isolated patches. It reduces gene flow, increases edge effects, and threatens many species."},
    {"prompt": "Edge effect in fragmented habitat means:", "answers": ["Only centre", "Different conditions at habitat boundary; can favour some species, harm others", "No effect", "Only positive"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Edge effects are the changes in environmental conditions and species composition at the boundary between two habitats. Edges may have more invasive species or predators."},
    {"prompt": "Species richness is:", "answers": ["Only abundance", "Number of different species in an area", "Only biomass", "Only density"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Species richness is simply the number of different species present in an area. It does not account for how many individuals of each species."},
    {"prompt": "Endemism is high in:", "answers": ["Only continents", "Islands and isolated regions (e.g. Western Ghats, Madagascar)", "Only deserts", "Only oceans"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Endemism is often high on islands and in isolated regions (mountains, peninsulas) due to evolution in isolation and unique habitats."},
    {"prompt": "Loss of biodiversity can lead to:", "answers": ["Only more species", "Reduced ecosystem services, loss of genetic resources, and instability", "Only benefits", "Only in one country"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Biodiversity loss affects ecosystem services (pollination, water purification), reduces genetic resources, and can make ecosystems less resilient."}
