[{"prompt": "Coral reefs are often called:", "answers": ["Deserts of ocean", "Rainforests of the sea (high biodiversity)", "Only rocks", "Only algae"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Coral reefs support an enormous diversity of life and are often called the rainforests of the sea."}, {"prompt": "Zooxanthellae in corals provide:", "answers": ["Only colour", "Nutrients and oxygen; corals provide shelter and CO2", "Only shelter", "Only CO2"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) provide corals with nutrients and oxygen from photosynthesis. Corals provide shelter and compounds for photosynthesis."}, {"prompt": "Coral bleaching can lead to:", "answers": ["More growth", "Coral death if stress is prolonged", "Only colour change", "Only in summer"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "If the stress (e.g. high temperature) continues, bleached corals can die. Recovery is possible if conditions improve quickly."}, {"prompt": "Lakshadweep has:", "answers": ["Only mangrove", "Coral reefs and lagoons", "Only sandy beach", "Only deep sea"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Lakshadweep islands have coral reefs and lagoons. They are ecologically sensitive and face threats from climate change and human activity."}, {"prompt": "Gulf of Mannar has:", "answers": ["Only fish", "Coral reefs, seagrass, diverse marine life", "Only mangrove", "Only sand"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Gulf of Mannar is known for its coral reefs, seagrass beds, and marine biodiversity. It is a Biosphere Reserve."}, {"prompt": "Andaman and Nicobar Islands have:", "answers": ["Only mangrove", "Coral reefs, mangroves, tropical forest", "Only forest", "Only beach"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Andaman and Nicobar Islands have rich coral reefs, mangroves, and tropical forests. They are a biodiversity hotspot (Sundaland)."}, {"prompt": "Seagrass beds:", "answers": ["Only grass", "Underwater flowering plants; nursery habitat, carbon storage", "Only in freshwater", "Only in deep sea"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Seagrasses are flowering plants that grow in shallow marine waters. They provide habitat, nursery grounds, and store carbon."}, {"prompt": "Ocean acidification affects:", "answers": ["Only fish", "Organisms with calcium carbonate shells/skeletons (corals, molluscs)", "Only plankton", "Only mammals"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Acidification reduces the availability of carbonate ions, making it harder for corals, molluscs, and some plankton to build shells and skeletons."}, {"prompt": "Marine Protected Area (MPA) aims to:", "answers": ["Only fishing ban", "Conserve marine biodiversity and ecosystems; may allow regulated use", "Only research", "Only tourism"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "MPAs are designated to protect marine ecosystems and species. They may allow regulated activities like sustainable fishing or tourism."}, {"prompt": "Sustainable fishing aims at:", "answers": ["Only more catch", "Harvesting without depleting stocks or harming ecosystem", "Only big fish", "Only one species"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Sustainable fishing ensures that fish stocks and marine ecosystems are not overexploited and can replenish."}, {"prompt": "Bycatch refers to:", "answers": ["Only target species", "Non-target species caught accidentally (often discarded)", "Only fish", "Only shrimp"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Bycatch is the unintended capture of non-target species (e.g. dolphins, turtles, juvenile fish) during fishing. It can cause waste and harm to populations."}, {"prompt": "Overfishing can lead to:", "answers": ["More fish", "Decline of fish stocks, ecosystem change", "Only small fish", "Only in one area"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Overfishing depletes fish populations, can alter marine food webs, and harm livelihoods dependent on fisheries."}, {"prompt": "Mangrove destruction increases:", "answers": ["Only land", "Vulnerability to cyclones and erosion; loss of nursery habitat", "Only fish", "Only birds"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Mangroves protect coasts from storms and erosion. Their loss increases vulnerability to cyclones and reduces habitat for fish and other species."}, {"prompt": "Blue carbon ecosystems include:", "answers": ["Only ocean", "Mangroves, seagrass beds, salt marshes (store carbon)", "Only coral", "Only fish"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Blue carbon refers to carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems: mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes. They are important for climate mitigation."}, {"prompt": "Plastic in ocean can:", "answers": ["Only float", "Harm wildlife (ingestion, entanglement), break into microplastics", "Only sink", "Only in coast"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Marine plastic harms wildlife through ingestion and entanglement. It breaks down into microplastics that enter the food chain."}, {"prompt": "IUCN categories for protected areas include:", "answers": ["Only one", "Strict reserve, national park, natural monument, habitat/species management, etc.", "Only two", "Only five"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "IUCN has categories I–VI for protected areas, from strict nature reserve to protected area with sustainable use of natural resources."}, {"prompt": "World Heritage natural sites are designated by:", "answers": ["Only IUCN", "UNESCO (based on criteria including natural significance)", "Only UNEP", "Only CBD"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "UNESCO designates World Heritage Sites (cultural and natural). Natural sites must meet criteria such as outstanding universal value."}, {"prompt": "Manas, Kaziranga, and Keoladeo are:", "answers": ["Only parks", "UNESCO World Heritage Sites (natural) in India", "Only in Assam", "Only for birds"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Manas, Kaziranga, and Keoladeo National Park are among India's natural World Heritage Sites designated by UNESCO."}, {"prompt": "Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers are:", "answers": ["Only in Uttarakhand", "UNESCO World Heritage Site (natural)", "Only valley", "Only mountain"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Nanda Devi National Park and Valley of Flowers National Park together form a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Uttarakhand."}, {"prompt": "Western Ghats World Heritage Site includes:", "answers": ["Only one state", "Serial site across several states (Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, etc.)", "Only Kerala", "Only Karnataka"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The Western Ghats are inscribed as a serial World Heritage Site comprising multiple protected areas across several states."}]
