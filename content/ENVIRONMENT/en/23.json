[{"prompt": "Trophic level 1 in an ecosystem is always:", "answers": ["Herbivore", "Producer", "Carnivore", "Decomposer"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Trophic level 1 is always occupied by producers (plants, algae) that capture energy from the sun."}, {"prompt": "Maximum energy in an ecosystem is at:", "answers": ["Top predator", "Producer level", "Decomposer", "Secondary consumer"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Producers have the maximum biomass and energy. Energy decreases at each higher trophic level (10% rule)."}, {"prompt": "Scavengers feed on:", "answers": ["Living plants", "Dead animals (carrion)", "Only insects", "Only plants"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Scavengers (e.g. vultures, hyenas) feed on dead animal matter. They help in decomposition and nutrient cycling."}, {"prompt": "Saprophytes are:", "answers": ["Producers", "Organisms that feed on dead organic matter (e.g. fungi, bacteria)", "Only animals", "Only plants"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Saprophytes (e.g. many fungi and bacteria) obtain nutrition from dead and decaying organic matter."}, {"prompt": "Parasitic food chain starts with:", "answers": ["Predator", "Host (living organism); parasite feeds on it", "Only plant", "Only animal"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "In a parasitic chain, parasites feed on living hosts. Energy flows from host to parasite (and possibly to hyperparasites)."}, {"prompt": "Grazing food chain starts with:", "answers": ["Carnivore", "Living green plants", "Dead matter", "Only algae"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Grazing food chain starts with living producers (plants/algae) eaten by herbivores, then carnivores."}, {"prompt": "Detritus food chain starts with:", "answers": ["Living plant", "Dead organic matter (detritus)", "Only animal", "Only bacteria"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Detritus food chain begins with dead organic matter (detritus). Detritivores and decomposers break it down."}, {"prompt": "Ecological efficiency is typically:", "answers": ["90%", "About 10% (most energy lost between trophic levels)", "50%", "100%"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Only about 10% of energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next. The rest is lost as heat or used in metabolism."}, {"prompt": "Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is:", "answers": ["Only respiration", "Total energy fixed by producers by photosynthesis", "Only net", "Only in ocean"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "GPP is the total rate at which producers capture and fix energy. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) = GPP minus respiration."}, {"prompt": "Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is:", "answers": ["Only GPP", "GPP minus respiration (energy available to consumers)", "Only respiration", "Only biomass"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "NPP is the energy or biomass remaining after producers have used some for respiration. It is available to herbivores and decomposers."}, {"prompt": "Standing crop refers to:", "answers": ["Only harvest", "Total biomass present at a given time", "Only growth", "Only animals"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Standing crop is the total biomass (or energy) present in a population or trophic level at a particular time."}, {"prompt": "Ecological pyramid of energy is always:", "answers": ["Inverted", "Upright (energy decreases at each level)", "Only in water", "Only in forest"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Pyramid of energy is always upright because energy is lost at each trophic level. It cannot be inverted."}, {"prompt": "Biogeochemical cycle that has no significant gaseous phase:", "answers": ["Nitrogen", "Phosphorus", "Carbon", "Water"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Phosphorus cycle is mainly sedimentary (rock, soil, water). Unlike carbon and nitrogen, it has no major atmospheric reservoir."}, {"prompt": "Denitrification converts:", "answers": ["N2 to nitrate", "Nitrate to N2 (nitrogen gas); done by bacteria", "Ammonia to nitrate", "Nitrate to ammonia"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Denitrification is the process by which certain bacteria convert nitrate back to nitrogen gas (N2), releasing it to the atmosphere."}, {"prompt": "Nitrification converts:", "answers": ["N2 to ammonia", "Ammonia to nitrate (by bacteria)", "Nitrate to N2", "Only in soil"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Nitrification is the conversion of ammonia to nitrite and then to nitrate by soil bacteria (e.g. Nitrosomonas, Nitrobacter)."}, {"prompt": "Ammonification is:", "answers": ["Only industrial", "Conversion of organic nitrogen to ammonia by decomposers", "Only in water", "Only by plants"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Ammonification (or mineralisation) is the process by which decomposers break down organic nitrogen (e.g. in dead matter) into ammonia."}, {"prompt": "Water cycle is driven mainly by:", "answers": ["Only gravity", "Solar energy (evaporation) and gravity (precipitation)", "Only wind", "Only plants"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The water cycle is driven by solar energy (evaporation, transpiration) and gravity (precipitation, runoff)."}, {"prompt": "Transpiration is:", "answers": ["Only evaporation from soil", "Loss of water vapour from plants through stomata", "Only from ocean", "Only from lakes"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Transpiration is the loss of water vapour from plant surfaces, mainly through stomata in leaves. It is a major part of the water cycle."}, {"prompt": "Evapotranspiration includes:", "answers": ["Only evaporation", "Evaporation from surfaces plus transpiration from plants", "Only transpiration", "Only precipitation"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Evapotranspiration is the sum of evaporation from land/water surfaces and transpiration from plants."}, {"prompt": "Carbon is stored in:", "answers": ["Only air", "Atmosphere, oceans, fossil fuels, soil, biomass", "Only soil", "Only forest"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Carbon is stored in the atmosphere (CO2), oceans, fossil fuels, soil, and living biomass. Deforestation and fossil fuel use release it."}]
