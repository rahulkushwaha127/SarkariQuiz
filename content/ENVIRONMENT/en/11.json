    {"prompt": "Acid rain has pH:", "answers": ["Above 7", "Below 5.6 (normal rain ~5.6)", "Exactly 7", "Above 8"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Acid rain has a pH below 5.6. Normal rain is slightly acidic (~5.6) due to CO2. SO2 and NOx from burning fossil fuels make it more acidic."},
    {"prompt": "Acid rain can damage:", "answers": ["Only soil", "Forests, aquatic life, buildings, soil (leaching nutrients)", "Only water", "Only air"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Acid rain damages trees, acidifies lakes and streams (harming fish), corrodes buildings and monuments, and leaches nutrients from soil."},
    {"prompt": "Eutrophication is mainly due to excess:", "answers": ["Oxygen", "Nitrogen and phosphorus (from fertilisers, sewage)", "Carbon", "Sulphur"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Eutrophication is caused by excess nutrients—especially nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural runoff and sewage—leading to algal blooms."},
    {"prompt": "Red tide is:", "answers": ["Only colour", "Harmful algal bloom (often dinoflagellates) that can produce toxins", "Only in freshwater", "Only in winter"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Red tide is a harmful algal bloom (often reddish) caused by dinoflagellates. Some produce toxins that harm marine life and humans."},
    {"prompt": "Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act was enacted to:", "answers": ["Only ban water use", "Levy cess on water consumed by certain industries to fund pollution control", "Only punish", "Only monitor"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The Water Cess Act levies a cess on water consumed by industries and local authorities to generate funds for pollution control boards."},
    {"prompt": "Noise standards for residential areas in India (day) are typically:", "answers": ["Unlimited", "55 dB (day), 45 dB (night) as per CPCB", "100 dB", "30 dB only"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "CPCB has set ambient noise standards: for residential areas 55 dB (day) and 45 dB (night). Silence zones have stricter limits."},
    {"prompt": "Ozone as air pollutant (ground-level) is formed from:", "answers": ["Only factories", "Reaction of NOx and VOCs in presence of sunlight", "Only vehicles", "Only burning"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Ground-level (bad) ozone is not emitted directly but forms when nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react in sunlight."},
    {"prompt": "VOCs stand for:", "answers": ["Very organic carbon", "Volatile Organic Compounds (evaporate easily; contribute to smog)", "Volume of carbon", "Valuable organic content"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are organic chemicals that evaporate easily. They react with NOx to form ground-level ozone and smog."},
    {"prompt": "Criteria pollutants under NAAQS include:", "answers": ["Only one", "PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, CO, lead, NH3 (notified by CPCB)", "Only gases", "Only particles"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "NAAQS in India cover criteria pollutants: PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, O3, CO, Pb, NH3. These are monitored for ambient air quality."},
    {"prompt": "Waste minimisation means:", "answers": ["Only recycle", "Reducing waste at source (less generation)", "Only reuse", "Only dispose"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Waste minimisation aims to reduce the amount of waste generated at source through efficient design, process change, and reuse."},
    {"prompt": "Environmental clearance for projects is given under:", "answers": ["Only state", "EIA notification under Environment (Protection) Act", "Only central", "Only NGT"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Environmental clearance for certain projects is mandated under the EIA notification (under EPA 1986). It involves screening, scoping, and public hearing."},
    {"prompt": "Category A projects in EIA require clearance from:", "answers": ["Only state", "Central government (MoEFCC)", "Only district", "Only SPCB"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Category A projects (large or sensitive) require environmental clearance from the central government (MoEFCC). Category B projects are cleared by SEIAA at state level."},
    {"prompt": "Public hearing in EIA is for:", "answers": ["Only industry", "Consulting affected people and considering their views before clearance", "Only government", "Only experts"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Public hearing is a step in the EIA process where the views of affected communities and the public are heard and considered before granting clearance."},
    {"prompt": "Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 requires:", "answers": ["Only state permission", "Central government approval for diversion of forest land for non-forest use", "Only payment", "Only notification"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 requires central government approval for diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. It has helped curb unchecked deforestation."},
    {"prompt": "CAMPA stands for:", "answers": ["Central Air Management and Protection Authority", "Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority", "Conservation of Aquatic and Marine Protected Areas", "Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Planning Agency"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "CAMPA manages funds collected for compensatory afforestation when forest land is diverted. The money is used for afforestation and conservation."},
    {"prompt": "Wildlife (Protection) Act has how many schedules?", "answers": ["Two", "Six (Schedules I–VI; different levels of protection)", "Four", "Eight"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The Wildlife (Protection) Act has six schedules. Schedule I and II (Part I) give highest protection. Schedules III–VI have varying levels; Schedule V lists vermin."},
    {"prompt": "Hunting of Schedule I species is:", "answers": ["Allowed with permit", "Prohibited (except in very exceptional cases under strict conditions)", "Only in sanctuary", "Only in zoo"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Schedule I species (e.g. tiger, lion, elephant) are accorded the highest protection. Hunting is prohibited. Exception may be allowed only in rare cases with permission."},
    {"prompt": "Project Elephant is implemented by:", "answers": ["Only NTCA", "Ministry of Environment; state governments manage elephant reserves", "Only state", "Only NGO"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Project Elephant is a centrally sponsored scheme. MoEFCC provides support; state governments establish and manage elephant reserves and corridors."},
    {"prompt": "Migratory bird agreement that India is party to includes:", "answers": ["Only Ramsar", "CMS (Convention on Migratory Species), bilateral agreements (e.g. with Russia)", "Only CITES", "Only Bonn"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "India is a party to the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS/Bonn Convention) and has bilateral agreements for conservation of migratory species (e.g. with Russia for cranes)."},
