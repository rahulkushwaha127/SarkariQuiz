[{"prompt": "Biomagnification occurs when:", "answers": ["Only in water", "Concentration of toxin increases at higher trophic levels in food chain", "Only in plants", "Only in one species"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Biomagnification is when the concentration of a substance (e.g. DDT, mercury) increases at successive trophic levels because predators accumulate from many prey."}, {"prompt": "DDT was banned or restricted because:", "answers": ["Only expensive", "Persists in environment; biomagnifies; caused eggshell thinning in birds", "Only ineffective", "Only in USA"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "DDT persists in the environment, biomagnifies in food chains, and caused eggshell thinning in raptors (e.g. bald eagle). It is restricted under Stockholm Convention."}, {"prompt": "First trophic level in a food chain is always:", "answers": ["Herbivore", "Producer (autotroph)", "Carnivore", "Decomposer"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The first trophic level is always occupied by producers (plants, algae) that capture solar energy and convert it to chemical energy."}, {"prompt": "Secondary consumer in a food chain is typically:", "answers": ["Plant", "Carnivore that eats herbivores (primary consumers)", "Herbivore", "Decomposer"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Secondary consumers are carnivores (or omnivores) that eat primary consumers (herbivores). They occupy the third trophic level."}, {"prompt": "Ecological pyramid of biomass can be:", "answers": ["Only upright", "Upright (terrestrial) or inverted (e.g. aquatic – phytoplankton reproduce fast)", "Only inverted", "Only flat"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Pyramid of biomass is usually upright on land. In aquatic systems it can be inverted because phytoplankton have high turnover (small standing crop, high productivity)."}, {"prompt": "Ecological pyramid of numbers can be inverted when:", "answers": ["Only in forest", "One tree supports many herbivores (e.g. one tree, many insects)", "Only in ocean", "Never"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Pyramid of numbers can be inverted when a few large producers support many small consumers (e.g. one tree and many insects/birds)."}, {"prompt": "Nitrogen cycle involves:", "answers": ["Only plants", "Fixation, nitrification, assimilation, denitrification (bacteria key)", "Only animals", "Only soil"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The nitrogen cycle involves nitrogen fixation (by bacteria), nitrification, assimilation by plants, and denitrification. Bacteria play crucial roles."}, {"prompt": "Carbon cycle includes:", "answers": ["Only respiration", "Photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, fossil fuels, ocean uptake", "Only combustion", "Only plants"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The carbon cycle involves photosynthesis (CO2 to organic matter), respiration, decomposition, combustion of fossil fuels, and exchange with oceans."}, {"prompt": "Phosphorus cycle is different from nitrogen because:", "answers": ["Only in water", "No significant gaseous phase; mainly sedimentary (rock, soil, water)", "Only in air", "Only in plants"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Unlike nitrogen, phosphorus has no major atmospheric component. It cycles through rocks, soil, water, and organisms (sedimentary cycle)."}, {"prompt": "Nitrogen fixation is done by:", "answers": ["Only plants", "Certain bacteria (e.g. Rhizobium in legumes), some cyanobacteria", "Only animals", "Only fungi"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Nitrogen fixation (converting N2 to usable form) is carried out by bacteria (e.g. Rhizobium in legume roots) and cyanobacteria."}, {"prompt": "Deforestation increases atmospheric CO2 because:", "answers": ["Only burning", "Trees no longer absorb CO2; burning/release of stored carbon", "Only respiration", "Only decay"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Deforestation removes carbon sinks (trees). If forests are burned or decay, stored carbon is released as CO2. Less photosynthesis means less uptake."}, {"prompt": "Afforestation means:", "answers": ["Cutting trees", "Planting trees on land that was not recently forested", "Only in forest", "Only natural"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Afforestation is establishing forest on land that has not been forest for a long time. Reforestation is replanting on recently deforested land."}, {"prompt": "Social forestry aims at:", "answers": ["Only commercial timber", "Meeting local needs (fuel, fodder) and involving communities", "Only government", "Only industry"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Social forestry involves planting trees to meet the needs of local communities (fuelwood, fodder, small timber) and often involves community participation."}, {"prompt": "Joint Forest Management (JFM) involves:", "answers": ["Only government", "Partnership between forest department and local communities", "Only NGOs", "Only industry"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "JFM involves collaboration between the state forest department and local village communities for protection and management of forests and sharing benefits."}, {"prompt": "National Afforestation Programme is implemented by:", "answers": ["Only centre", "MoEFCC through state forest departments; village-level committees", "Only state", "Only NGOs"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "National Afforestation Programme is a centrally sponsored scheme implemented through state forest departments and village-level forest development agencies."}, {"prompt": "Desertification is addressed internationally by:", "answers": ["Only Ramsar", "UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification)", "Only CBD", "Only UNFCCC"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "UNCCD is the international convention to combat desertification and mitigate drought effects, especially in arid regions."}, {"prompt": "World Day to Combat Desertification is:", "answers": ["5 June", "17 June", "22 May", "3 March"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought is observed on 17 June to promote awareness and action against desertification."}, {"prompt": "Coral reefs are built by:", "answers": ["Only algae", "Tiny animals (coral polyps) in symbiosis with zooxanthellae (algae)", "Only fish", "Only plants"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Coral reefs are built by coral polyps (cnidarians) that harbour symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae). The algae provide nutrients; polyps build calcium carbonate skeleton."}, {"prompt": "Coral bleaching occurs when corals:", "answers": ["Grow more", "Expel zooxanthellae (lose colour) due to stress (e.g. warm water)", "Only die", "Only in deep water"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "When stressed (e.g. high temperature), corals expel their symbiotic zooxanthellae and turn white. If stress is prolonged, they can die."}, {"prompt": "Great Barrier Reef is in:", "answers": ["India", "Australia", "Indonesia", "Philippines"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The Great Barrier Reef is off the coast of Australia. It is the world's largest coral reef system and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."}]
