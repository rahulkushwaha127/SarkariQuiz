    {"prompt": "Greenhouse effect is:", "answers": ["Only harmful", "Natural process; trapping of heat by GHGs; enhanced by human emissions", "Only in summer", "Only over oceans"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The greenhouse effect is natural—GHGs trap some heat and keep Earth warm. Human activities have increased GHG concentrations, enhancing the effect and causing global warming."},
    {"prompt": "Main greenhouse gases include:", "answers": ["Only oxygen", "CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), water vapour", "Only nitrogen", "Only argon"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Major greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and water vapour. CFCs and ozone also contribute."},
    {"prompt": "Global warming causes:", "answers": ["Only colder winters", "Rising sea levels, melting ice, extreme weather, shift in species ranges", "Only more rain everywhere", "Only in poles"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Global warming leads to sea-level rise, glacier melt, more frequent extreme weather, changes in precipitation patterns, and impacts on biodiversity and agriculture."},
    {"prompt": "Ozone layer is found in:", "answers": ["Troposphere", "Stratosphere", "Mesosphere", "Ground level"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The ozone layer is in the stratosphere (roughly 15–35 km altitude). It absorbs most of the Sun's harmful UV radiation."},
    {"prompt": "Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) include:", "answers": ["Only CO2", "CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride", "Only methane", "Only NOx"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Ozone-depleting substances include CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), halons, carbon tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform. They release chlorine/bromine that destroy ozone."},
    {"prompt": "Montreal Protocol has been successful in:", "answers": ["Stopping climate change", "Phasing out ODS; ozone hole is recovering", "Stopping all pollution", "Stopping deforestation"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The Montreal Protocol successfully phased out most ODS. The ozone layer is showing signs of recovery. It is often cited as a successful global environmental agreement."},
    {"prompt": "Tropospheric ozone is:", "answers": ["Only good", "A pollutant and GHG; harmful to health and crops", "Only in stratosphere", "Only natural"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Ozone in the troposphere (ground-level) is a harmful air pollutant and greenhouse gas. Stratospheric ozone is beneficial (shields UV)."},
    {"prompt": "Global warming potential (GWP) compares:", "answers": ["Only weight", "Ability of a gas to trap heat relative to CO2 over a time period", "Only volume", "Only cost"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "GWP measures how much heat a greenhouse gas traps in the atmosphere relative to CO2 over a given period (e.g. 100 years). Methane has a high GWP."},
    {"prompt": "Methane is produced by:", "answers": ["Only industry", "Rice paddies, livestock, landfills, fossil fuel extraction", "Only cars", "Only oceans"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Methane sources include livestock (enteric fermentation), rice cultivation, landfills, fossil fuel extraction, and wetlands."},
    {"prompt": "Albedo effect refers to:", "answers": ["Only heat", "Reflectivity of surface; ice/snow have high albedo, reduce warming", "Only water", "Only forests"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Albedo is the fraction of solar radiation reflected by a surface. Ice and snow have high albedo. Melting ice reduces albedo and can amplify warming."},
    {"prompt": "Ocean acidification is caused by:", "answers": ["Only plastic", "Absorption of CO2 by oceans forming carbonic acid", "Only oil spill", "Only sewage"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Oceans absorb CO2, which reacts with water to form carbonic acid. This lowers pH (acidification), harming corals and shell-forming organisms."},
    {"prompt": "Pre-industrial level in climate context refers to:", "answers": ["Before 2000", "Baseline (often 1850–1900) before large-scale industrial GHG emissions", "Before 1950", "Before 1700"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Pre-industrial levels typically refer to the period 1850–1900, used as baseline for measuring global temperature rise (e.g. 1.5°C above pre-industrial)."},
    {"prompt": "CFCs were commonly used in:", "answers": ["Only fuel", "Refrigerants, aerosols, foam blowing", "Only plastics", "Only pesticides"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "CFCs were used in refrigeration, air conditioning, aerosol propellants, and foam. Their use has been largely phased out under the Montreal Protocol."},
    {"prompt": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas from:", "answers": ["Only industry", "Agriculture (fertilisers), industry, combustion", "Only vehicles", "Only oceans"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "N2O is emitted from agricultural soils (fertiliser use), industrial processes, and combustion. It has a high global warming potential."},
    {"prompt": "Feedback loop in climate means:", "answers": ["Only one effect", "One change triggers another that amplifies or dampens the first (e.g. ice-albedo feedback)", "Only human", "Only natural"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Climate feedbacks are processes where a change (e.g. warming) causes an effect (e.g. ice melt) that either amplifies (positive) or dampens (negative) the original change."},
    {"prompt": "Tipping point in climate means:", "answers": ["Small change", "Threshold beyond which irreversible or abrupt change occurs", "Only beneficial", "Only in ocean"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "A climate tipping point is a threshold beyond which the system undergoes large, often irreversible change (e.g. collapse of ice sheets, Amazon dieback)."},
    {"prompt": "Which is not a greenhouse gas?", "answers": ["CO2", "Oxygen (O2)", "Methane", "N2O"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) are not greenhouse gases—they do not absorb and re-emit infrared radiation. CO2, CH4, N2O, and water vapour are GHGs."},
    {"prompt": "Kyoto Protocol initially bound:", "answers": ["All countries equally", "Developed countries (Annex I) to emission reduction targets", "Only developing", "Only USA"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The Kyoto Protocol set binding emission reduction targets for developed (Annex I) countries. Developing countries had no binding targets under Kyoto."},
    {"prompt": "Carbon sink is:", "answers": ["Source of CO2", "Reservoir that absorbs more carbon than it releases (e.g. forests, oceans)", "Only forest fire", "Only industry"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "A carbon sink absorbs more CO2 than it releases. Forests, soils, and oceans act as natural carbon sinks."},
    {"prompt": "Radiative forcing measures:", "answers": ["Only temperature", "Change in energy balance of Earth (warming or cooling effect) due to a factor", "Only sunlight", "Only clouds"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Radiative forcing is the change in net irradiance (energy balance) at the top of the atmosphere due to a change in a driver (e.g. CO2 increase). Positive forcing causes warming."}
