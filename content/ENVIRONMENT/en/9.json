    {"prompt": "Primary source of air pollution in cities often includes:", "answers": ["Only dust", "Vehicles, industry, construction, biomass burning", "Only trees", "Only rain"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Urban air pollution comes from vehicles (tailpipe emissions), industry, power plants, construction dust, and biomass/crop residue burning."},
    {"prompt": "PM2.5 refers to:", "answers": ["Gaseous pollutant", "Particulate matter with diameter 2.5 micrometres or less; can enter lungs", "Only PM10", "Only soot"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "PM2.5 are fine particles (2.5 micrometres or less). They can penetrate deep into the lungs and are linked to respiratory and cardiovascular problems."},
    {"prompt": "AQI stands for:", "answers": ["Air Quality Index", "Aquatic Quality Index", "Atmospheric Quantity Index", "Air Quantity Indicator"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "AQI (Air Quality Index) is a scale used to communicate how polluted the air is. It is based on pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3."},
    {"prompt": "National Ambient Air Quality Standards in India are set by:", "answers": ["State government", "CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board)", "Only NGT", "Only WHO"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "CPCB notifies the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for various pollutants. States monitor and implement measures to meet them."},
    {"prompt": "Water pollution can be caused by:", "answers": ["Only industry", "Industrial discharge, sewage, agricultural runoff, solid waste", "Only rivers", "Only oceans"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Water pollution sources include untreated sewage, industrial effluents, agricultural runoff (fertilisers, pesticides), and solid waste dumping."},
    {"prompt": "BOD in water quality stands for:", "answers": ["Biological oxygen demand", "Biochemical oxygen demand (oxygen consumed by decomposing organic matter)", "Bulk oxygen density", "Base oxygen level"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) measures the amount of oxygen required by microorganisms to decompose organic matter in water. High BOD indicates pollution."},
    {"prompt": "DO in water stands for:", "answers": ["Only density", "Dissolved oxygen (essential for aquatic life)", "Only carbon", "Only nitrogen"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Dissolved Oxygen (DO) is the oxygen present in water. Adequate DO is essential for fish and other aquatic life. Pollution and warming can reduce DO."},
    {"prompt": "Eutrophication in water bodies leads to:", "answers": ["More oxygen", "Algal blooms, oxygen depletion, death of aquatic life", "Only clear water", "Only more fish"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Eutrophication from excess nutrients (N, P) causes excessive algal growth. When algae die, decomposition consumes oxygen, harming or killing aquatic life."},
    {"prompt": "Primary treatment of sewage removes:", "answers": ["Only chemicals", "Suspended solids (physical settling)", "Only bacteria", "Only nutrients"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Primary treatment involves physical processes (screening, sedimentation) to remove suspended solids. Secondary treatment uses biological processes to remove organic matter."},
    {"prompt": "Noise pollution is measured in:", "answers": ["Metres", "Decibels (dB)", "Kilograms", "Litres"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Noise is measured in decibels (dB). Prolonged exposure to high noise levels can cause hearing loss and stress. CPCB sets noise standards."},
    {"prompt": "Silent Valley was saved from:", "answers": ["Only mining", "A hydroelectric project that would have submerged the forest", "Only hunting", "Only grazing"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Silent Valley in Kerala was saved from a proposed hydroelectric project after a major campaign. It is now a national park and biodiversity hotspot."},
    {"prompt": "Chipko movement was for:", "answers": ["Water rights", "Forest conservation (hugging trees to prevent felling)", "Air quality", "Wildlife"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The Chipko movement (1970s) in Uttarakhand involved people hugging trees to prevent their felling. It highlighted forest conservation and community rights."},
    {"prompt": "Major source of soil pollution includes:", "answers": ["Only wind", "Industrial waste, pesticides, fertilisers, heavy metals", "Only water", "Only plants"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Soil pollution comes from industrial waste dumping, pesticides, fertilisers, heavy metals, and improper waste disposal."},
    {"prompt": "Bioremediation is:", "answers": ["Only chemical", "Use of living organisms (bacteria, plants) to clean up pollution", "Only physical", "Only mining"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Bioremediation uses microorganisms or plants to degrade or absorb pollutants (e.g. oil spills, heavy metals) from soil or water."},
    {"prompt": "Fly ash is a by-product of:", "answers": ["Only steel", "Coal-based thermal power plants", "Only cement", "Only paper"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Fly ash is the fine residue from burning coal in thermal power plants. It can be used in construction (e.g. cement) but improper disposal causes pollution."},
    {"prompt": "Lead in the environment can cause:", "answers": ["Only skin rash", "Neurological damage, especially in children; from leaded fuel, paint, batteries", "Only stomach ache", "Only eye irritation"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Lead exposure causes neurological and developmental damage, especially in children. Sources included leaded petrol (now phased out), paint, and batteries."},
    {"prompt": "Minamata disease is linked to:", "answers": ["Lead", "Mercury poisoning (industrial discharge into water)", "Arsenic", "Cadmium"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Minamata disease (Japan) was caused by mercury in industrial wastewater that accumulated in fish and affected people who ate them. It led to global mercury controls."},
    {"prompt": "Itai-itai disease was caused by:", "answers": ["Mercury", "Cadmium poisoning (from mining runoff in Japan)", "Lead", "Arsenic"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Itai-itai disease in Japan was caused by cadmium poisoning from mining discharge into rivers. It affected bones and kidneys."},
    {"prompt": "Secondary pollutant is formed:", "answers": ["Only directly from source", "In atmosphere by reaction of primary pollutants (e.g. ozone from NOx and VOCs)", "Only in water", "Only in soil"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Secondary pollutants are not emitted directly but form in the atmosphere from chemical reactions. Examples: ozone (from NOx and VOCs), acid rain (from SO2, NOx)."},
    {"prompt": "Smog is a mix of:", "answers": ["Only fog", "Fog and smoke/pollutants (e.g. particulate matter, ozone)", "Only smoke", "Only dust"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Smog is a combination of fog and smoke/pollutants. Photochemical smog (e.g. in cities) involves ozone and other pollutants formed in sunlight."}
