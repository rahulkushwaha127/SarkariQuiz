    {"prompt": "E-waste contains:", "answers": ["Only plastic", "Toxic metals (lead, mercury, cadmium) and valuable metals (gold, copper); needs safe handling", "Only glass", "Only paper"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "E-waste (electronic waste) contains hazardous substances (lead, mercury, cadmium) and valuable materials. Improper recycling causes pollution and health risks."},
    {"prompt": "E-Waste (Management) Rules in India aim to:", "answers": ["Only collect", "Regulate e-waste handling, recycling; extended producer responsibility (EPR)", "Only ban", "Only export"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "E-Waste (Management) Rules regulate collection, recycling, and disposal. They include Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) making producers responsible for end-of-life products."},
    {"prompt": "Hazardous waste is regulated under:", "answers": ["Only state", "Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management) Rules; Basel Convention", "Only industry", "Only CPCB"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Hazardous waste in India is regulated under the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management) Rules. International movement is governed by the Basel Convention."},
    {"prompt": "Biomedical waste includes:", "answers": ["Only paper", "Infectious waste from hospitals (needles, tissues, chemicals)", "Only plastic", "Only metal"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Biomedical waste includes infectious and hazardous waste from healthcare—needles, syringes, tissues, blood, chemicals. It is regulated under Biomedical Waste Management Rules."},
    {"prompt": "3R in waste management stands for:", "answers": ["Only recycle", "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle", "Only reduce", "Only reuse"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "3R stands for Reduce (less waste), Reuse (use again), Recycle (convert to new product). It is a hierarchy for sustainable waste management."},
    {"prompt": "Landfill is:", "answers": ["Only recycling", "Site for disposal of waste by burying; can cause leachate and methane", "Only composting", "Only incineration"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "A landfill is a designated site where waste is buried. Poorly managed landfills can produce leachate (contaminating groundwater) and methane (greenhouse gas)."},
    {"prompt": "Incineration of waste:", "answers": ["Only reduces volume", "Burns waste; reduces volume but can release pollutants if not controlled", "Only produces energy", "Only safe"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Incineration burns waste, reducing volume and sometimes generating energy. Without proper controls it can release dioxins and other pollutants."},
    {"prompt": "Composting is:", "answers": ["Only for plastic", "Biological decomposition of organic waste into nutrient-rich compost", "Only for metal", "Only for paper"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Composting is the natural process of decomposing organic waste (food, garden waste) into compost that can be used to enrich soil."},
    {"prompt": "Swachh Bharat Mission aims at:", "answers": ["Only rural", "Cleanliness, open defecation free (ODF), solid waste management (rural and urban)", "Only urban", "Only toilets"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission) aims at eliminating open defecation, improving solid waste management, and promoting cleanliness in rural and urban areas."},
    {"prompt": "Namami Gange programme is for:", "answers": ["Only irrigation", "Cleaning and rejuvenating the Ganga river (pollution abatement, sewage, afforestation)", "Only hydropower", "Only tourism"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Namami Gange is a flagship programme for the conservation and rejuvenation of the Ganga—sewage treatment, pollution control, and sustainable management."},
    {"prompt": "Marine plastic pollution is addressed by:", "answers": ["Only one country", "International efforts; India has coastal and plastic waste rules", "Only UN", "Only NGOs"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Marine plastic is addressed through national rules (waste management, plastic bans) and international initiatives. UNEA has discussed a global plastic treaty."},
    {"prompt": "Single-use plastic refers to:", "answers": ["Reusable many times", "Plastic used once and discarded (bags, straws, cutlery)", "Only bags", "Only bottles"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Single-use plastics are designed to be used once and then discarded—e.g. carry bags, straws, disposable cutlery. Many countries are restricting or banning them."},
    {"prompt": "Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) means:", "answers": ["Only consumer pays", "Producer responsible for product at end of life (collection, recycling)", "Only government", "Only recyclers"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "EPR makes producers responsible for the entire life cycle of their products, including take-back, recycling, or safe disposal at end of life."},
    {"prompt": "Plastic waste management rules in India promote:", "answers": ["Only landfill", "Segregation, recycling, EPR, phase-out of certain plastics", "Only burn", "Only export"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Plastic Waste Management Rules promote segregation, recycling, use of recycled content, and EPR. Some single-use items have been phased out."},
    {"prompt": "Leachate from landfill is:", "answers": ["Only water", "Liquid that percolates through waste; can contaminate groundwater if not collected", "Only gas", "Only solid"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Leachate is the liquid that drains from a landfill as water percolates through waste. It can contain toxic substances and must be collected and treated."},
    {"prompt": "Waste-to-energy plants:", "answers": ["Only burn", "Convert waste to energy (heat/electricity) through incineration or biogas; need emission controls", "Only compost", "Only landfill"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Waste-to-energy facilities burn waste to generate heat or electricity. They can reduce landfill volume but require strict emission controls."},
    {"prompt": "Segregation of waste at source means:", "answers": ["Only at landfill", "Separating waste (dry/wet, recyclable) at point of generation", "Only by workers", "Only in industry"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Source segregation means separating waste (e.g. dry and wet, or recyclables) where it is generated (home, office) to enable recycling and proper treatment."},
    {"prompt": "Microplastics are:", "answers": ["Large plastic items", "Tiny plastic particles (often from breakdown of larger plastic); found in water, soil, organisms", "Only in ocean", "Only man-made"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Microplastics are small plastic particles (typically under 5 mm). They come from breakdown of larger plastic or from products (e.g. microbeads) and are found globally in water and organisms."}
