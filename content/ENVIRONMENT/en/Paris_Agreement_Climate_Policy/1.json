    {"prompt": "Global stocktake under Paris aims to:", "answers": ["Only count emissions", "Assess collective progress towards Paris goals every 5 years", "Only for one country", "Only for 2030"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The global stocktake assesses collective progress towards the Paris Agreement's long-term goals. The first was in 2023 (COP28)."},
    {"prompt": "IPCC was established by:", "answers": ["Only one country", "WMO and UNEP (1988)", "Only UNEP", "Only WHO"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)."},
    {"prompt": "IPCC produces:", "answers": ["Only data", "Assessment reports synthesising climate science; does not do original research", "Only forecasts", "Only policy"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "IPCC produces assessment reports that review and synthesise published scientific literature on climate change. It does not conduct original research."},
    {"prompt": "UNFCCC secretariat is in:", "answers": ["New York", "Bonn", "Geneva", "Paris"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The UNFCCC secretariat is located in Bonn, Germany. It supports the Convention and the COP meetings."},
    {"prompt": "Common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) means:", "answers": ["All same", "Countries have different obligations based on development and historical emissions", "Only developed responsible", "Only developing responsible"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "CBDR recognises that developed countries should take the lead in addressing climate change given their historical emissions and capability."},
    {"prompt": "Carbon trading allows:", "answers": ["Only emission increase", "Trading of emission permits/carbon credits to meet targets cost-effectively", "Only developing countries", "Only one sector"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Carbon trading (emissions trading) allows entities to buy/sell emission permits or credits, enabling cost-effective achievement of emission targets."},
    {"prompt": "Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) was under:", "answers": ["Paris", "Kyoto Protocol (projects in developing countries to earn credits)", "Montreal", "Ramsar"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "CDM under the Kyoto Protocol allowed developed countries to invest in emission-reduction projects in developing countries and receive credits."},
    {"prompt": "Climate mitigation means:", "answers": ["Only adapt", "Reducing or preventing GHG emissions to limit warming", "Only studying", "Only reporting"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Mitigation involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. renewable energy, energy efficiency) or enhancing sinks to limit climate change."},
    {"prompt": "Climate adaptation means:", "answers": ["Only reduce emissions", "Adjusting to actual or expected climate impacts to reduce harm", "Only for industry", "Only for cities"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Adaptation involves adjusting systems (e.g. agriculture, infrastructure, health) to actual or expected climate impacts to reduce vulnerability."},
    {"prompt": "Loss and damage in climate context refers to:", "answers": ["Only insurance", "Harm from climate change that cannot be avoided by mitigation or adaptation", "Only floods", "Only developed countries"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Loss and damage refers to impacts of climate change that cannot be or have not been avoided by mitigation and adaptation. It is a key issue for vulnerable countries."},
    {"prompt": "COP28 was held in:", "answers": ["Paris", "Dubai, UAE (2023)", "Bonn", "Glasgow"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "COP28 was held in Dubai, UAE, in 2023. It addressed global stocktake, loss and damage fund, and fossil fuel transition."},
    {"prompt": "Green Climate Fund (GCF) is for:", "answers": ["Only developed countries", "Supporting developing countries in mitigation and adaptation", "Only adaptation", "Only mitigation"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The Green Climate Fund (GCF) under UNFCCC finances climate mitigation and adaptation projects in developing countries."},
    {"prompt": "India's commitment under Paris includes:", "answers": ["Only 2030 target", "NDC with emission intensity reduction, non-fossil capacity, carbon sink (forests)", "Only 2050", "Only renewable"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "India's NDC includes reducing emissions intensity of GDP, increasing non-fossil energy capacity, and creating additional carbon sink through forests."},
    {"prompt": "Net zero means:", "answers": ["Zero emissions only", "Balance between emissions produced and emissions removed (sinks); net emissions = zero", "Only for one year", "Only for CO2 from industry"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Net zero means that the amount of greenhouse gases emitted equals the amount removed from the atmosphere (by sinks or technology), so net emissions are zero."},
    {"prompt": "1.5°C goal in Paris refers to:", "answers": ["Current temperature", "Limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels", "Only in 2100", "Only land temperature"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The Paris Agreement aims to limit warming to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels to reduce severe impacts."},
    {"prompt": "Annex I parties in UNFCCC are:", "answers": ["Only developing", "Developed countries and economies in transition (with emission targets under Kyoto)", "Only EU", "Only USA"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Annex I parties under UNFCCC are industrialised countries that had binding targets under the Kyoto Protocol."},
    {"prompt": "Non-Annex I parties are:", "answers": ["Only developed", "Developing countries (no binding targets under Kyoto)", "Only least developed", "Only small islands"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Non-Annex I parties are developing countries. Under Kyoto they had no binding emission reduction targets."},
    {"prompt": "Climate finance refers to:", "answers": ["Only domestic", "Finance for mitigation and adaptation, often from developed to developing countries", "Only private", "Only for fossil fuels"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "Climate finance is local, national, or transnational finance aimed at mitigation or adaptation. It often refers to support from developed to developing countries under UNFCCC."}
