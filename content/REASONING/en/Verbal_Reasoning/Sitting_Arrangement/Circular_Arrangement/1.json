    {"prompt": "All face center. X is to immediate left of Y. In which direction is X from Y?", "answers": ["Counter-clockwise", "Clockwise", "Opposite", "Same position"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Left = counter-clockwise when facing center."},
    {"prompt": "Circular table with 8 seats. How many pairs of opposite people?", "answers": ["4 pairs", "8 pairs", "2 pairs", "6 pairs"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Each person has one opposite; 8÷2=4 pairs."},

    {"prompt": "In circle facing center, if I point to my right, I point:", "answers": ["Clockwise direction", "Counter-clockwise", "To center", "Outside"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Right = clockwise when facing center."},
    {"prompt": "6 friends sit in circle. Each has exactly one opposite person. True or false?", "answers": ["True (each person has unique opposite)", "False", "Depends", "No opposites exist"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "In even-number circle, everyone has one opposite."},
    {"prompt": "Odd number of people (5) in circle. Does everyone have a direct opposite?", "answers": ["No (odd numbers don't have exact opposites)", "Yes", "Some do", "All have two opposites"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Odd circles have no exact opposites."},
    {"prompt": "A is 4th to right of B in 10-person circle. B is how many to right of A?", "answers": ["6 (10-4)", "4", "5", "8"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Reverse direction: 10-4=6 to right."},
    {"prompt": "In circular arrangement, '2nd to the right' skips how many people?", "answers": ["1 person (lands on 2nd)", "0", "2", "3"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "2nd to right: skip 1, land on 2nd."},
    {"prompt": "Facing outward (backs to center), right direction is:", "answers": ["Counter-clockwise", "Clockwise", "Same as facing in", "No direction"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Facing out reverses left/right."},
    {"prompt": "A, B, C, D, E, F sit clockwise. Who is 3rd to left of D?", "answers": ["A (going counter-clockwise: D→C→B→A)", "F", "E", "B"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Left = counter-clockwise."},
    {"prompt": "In circle, maximum people between any two is:", "answers": ["(Total÷2)-1 for even, similar for odd", "Total", "Total-1", "1"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Opposite people have maximum gap."},
    {"prompt": "If A sees B on right side while facing center:", "answers": ["B is clockwise to A", "B is counter-clockwise", "B is opposite", "B is behind A"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Right side = clockwise direction."},

    {"prompt": "Two people swap seats in circle. Others stay. Effect:", "answers": ["Only swapping pair changes; circular order mostly preserved", "Everyone changes", "Circle breaks", "No effect"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Swap affects only those two positions."},
    {"prompt": "In 8-person circle, A and B have 3 people between them (one way). Other way:", "answers": ["3 people too? No: 8-2-3=3. Both ways same only if symmetric", "4 people (8-3-1-1=3)", "2 people", "5 people"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Both ways: 3 between one way means 3 other way = total 8? Let me recalculate: A, 3 people, B = 5 positions. Other way = 8-5=3 positions, meaning 2 between. Check: 3+B+2+A=6, not 8. Actually: A-1-2-3-B = 5 positions occupied. 8-5=3 remaining on other side of A and B, meaning 1 between? This needs care."},
    {"prompt": "Key difference between linear and circular arrangements:", "answers": ["Circle has no ends; linear has two ends", "Same logic", "Circle is smaller", "Linear is round"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Circular is continuous; linear has endpoints."}
